## Hi there üëã

I'm a huge game enthusiast and I code! I have pretty much been playing games my entire life and I'm at the point where I want to see my ideas imagined. Games like AdventureQuest Worlds were one of the first games I ever played. It was pretty cool to see my character move across the screen and watch him level up. Games these days have taken that charm and gone above and beyond. 

Here I am at the University of Illinois Chicago learning all I can to code and develop programs. I hope to eventually learn enough to develop whatever I put my mind to.

I'm working with HTML and Quantify, and the project I'm working on, has a lot of it.

‚å®Ô∏è I'm currently working on ...

- [Quantify](https://github.com/majorandres/Quantify) with some friends. It is a webapp for small business owners to manage their inventory.
- Fixing up [Takedown](https://github.com/ax25-make/Takedown). A little game for time management.
